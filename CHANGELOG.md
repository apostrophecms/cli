# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Adds

- Adds a spinner indicator during package install to avoid the impression that the process is failing.

## 3.0.1 (2021-08-03)

- Updates ESLint to v7 to meet the eslint-config-apostrophe peer dependency requirement.

## 3.0.0 (2021-06-16)

- The initial build of the overhauled ApostropheCMS CLI. Uses the `3.0.0` major version number as this is very much an advanced version of the `apostrophe-cli` package (currently at 2.x.x), but moved to a new package name for logistical reasons.
