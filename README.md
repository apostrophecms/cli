# Apostrophe CLI

The Apostrophe CLI is a cross-platform starting point for creating and configuring [ApostropheCMS](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe) projects, providing a simple boilerplate generator and wrapping other useful functions into an easy to use command line tool.

**Requires Node.js 8+**

First, install `apostrophe-cli` as a global NPM module:

```bash
npm install -g apostrophe-cli
```

To view the available commands in a given context, execute the `apos` command with no arguments:

```bash
apos
```

**Note:** All Apostrophe CLI commands can also be run with `apostrophe`, the legacy command, in addition to `apos`.

## Create a project

To create a new project with the tool:
```bash
apos create-project <shortname-without-spaces>
```

This will create a local copy of our standard [Apostrophe Boilerplate](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-boilerplate).

### options

Run `create-project` with a `--boilerplate` flag to start from a Github repository other than the standard `apostrophe-boilerplate` repo. For example, `apos create-project <shortname-without-spaces> --boilerplate=https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-open-museum.git` would create a project using the [Open Museum](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-open-museum) demo.

TODO: `--a2`

If you run the `create-project` command with the `--setup` flag, the command will also `npm install` the dependencies for the project and run `apostrophe-users:add` to create an admin user for the CMS, resulting in a fully bootstrapped project. This command will prompt you for a password for the admin user being created.

## Create a widget
To bootstrap the necessary files and basic configuration for a new Apostrophe widget, run the following command from within your Apostrophe project's root directory:
```bash
# "-widgets" will automatically be appended to the end of your module name
apos create-widget fancy-button
```

**Note:** You will then need to register this widget module in `app.js` so it is available in your project code. The same is true for the commands below when you create a piece module or generic module.

```javascript
// app.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  'fancy-button-widgets': {},
  // ...
}
```

Add a `--player` option to the command to include the client-side Javascript "player" boilerplate to the new widget module as well.

```bash
apos create-widget tabs --player
```

## Create a piece
To bootstrap the necessary files and basic configuration for a new Apostrophe piece type, run the following command from within your Apostrophe project's root directory:

```bash
apos create-piece vegetables
```

Then remember to register `'vegetables': {}` in `apps.js` above.

If you run the `create-piece` command with the `--pages` flag, the command will also set up a corresponding pieces-pages module with your new piece type. Similarly, you can run the `create-piece` command with the `--widgets` flag, which will also set up a corresponding pieces-widgets module along with your new piece type. These flags can be used together or separately.

```bash
apos create-piece vegetable --pages --widgets
```

## Create an empty Apostrophe module
To bootstrap the necessary files and basic configuration for a brand-new Apostrophe module that doesn't extend one of the usual suspects like pieces or widgets:
```bash
apos create-module <module name>
```

Remember to register the module in `apps.js` with the other module types.
