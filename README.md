# Apostrophe CLI

The Apostrophe CLI is a cross-platform starting point for creating and configuring [ApostropheCMS](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe) projects, providing a simple boilerplate generator and wrapping other useful functions into an easy to use command line tool.

**Requires Node.js 8+**

First, install `@apostrophecms/cli` as a global NPM module:

```bash
npm install -g @apostrophecms/cli
```

To view the available commands in a given context, execute the `apos` command with no arguments:

```bash
apos
```

**Note:** All Apostrophe CLI commands can also be run with `apostrophe`, the legacy command, in addition to `apos`.

## Create a project

To create a new project with the tool:
```bash
apos create <shortname-without-spaces>
```

This will create a local copy of the [Apostrophe 3 boilerplate](https://github.com/apostrophecms/a3-boilerplate).

### options

#### `--a2`

Use the `--a2` flag when creating an Apostrophe 2 project to use [the boilerplate](http://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-boilerplate) for that version.

#### `--starter`

Run `create` with a `--starter` flag to start from a Github repository other than the standard starters. For example, `apos create <shortname-without-spaces> --starter=https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-open-museum.git` would create a project using the [Open Museum](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-open-museum) demo. The `--starter` flag also accepts shortened names for any of the [existing starter kits](https://github.com/orgs/apostrophecms/repositories?q=starter-kit&type=all) that consists of the name of the repo with the `starter-kit-` prefix removed. For example, `apos create <shortname-without-spaces> --starter=ecommerce` for the `starter-kit-ecommerce` repo. Finally, if you are using a personal or organizational repo, you can prefix your repo with it's location followed by the name to automatically add `https://github.com/`. For example, `apos create <shortname-without-spaces> --starter=mycoolcompany/my-starter`.

#### `--uri`
If you are not using a locally hosted MongoDB server, you can provide a connection string with the `--uri` flag. For the standard Atlas connection string you will need to add quotes due to the query parameters. This **does not** add your connection string to the project, it only allows for the creation of an admin user during project creation. You will still need to pass a connection string through the `APOS_MONGODB_URI` environment variable when starting your project locally.


## Create a widget
To bootstrap the necessary files and basic configuration for a new Apostrophe widget, run the following command from within your Apostrophe project's root directory:
```bash
# "-widgets" will automatically be appended to the end of your module name
apos add widget fancy-button
```

**Note:** You will then need to register this widget module in `app.js` so it is available in your project code. The same is true for the commands below when you create a piece module or generic module.

```javascript
// app.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  'fancy-button-widgets': {},
  // ...
}
```

Add a `--player` option to the command to include the client-side Javascript "player" boilerplate to the new widget module as well.

```bash
apos add widget tabs --player
```

## Create a piece
To bootstrap the necessary files and basic configuration for a new Apostrophe piece type, run the following command from within your Apostrophe project's root directory:

```bash
apos add piece vegetable
```

Then remember to register `'vegetable': {}` in `app.js` above.

If you run the `add piece` command with the `--page` flag, the command will also set up a corresponding piece-pages module with your new piece type. Similarly, you can run the `add piece` command with the `--widget` flag, which will also set up a corresponding piece-widgets module along with your new piece type. These flags can be used together or separately.

```bash
apos add piece vegetable --page --widget
```

## Create an empty Apostrophe module
To bootstrap the necessary files and basic configuration for a brand-new Apostrophe module that doesn't extend one of the usual suspects like pieces or widgets:
```bash
apos add module <module name>
```

Remember to register the module in `app.js` with the other module types.
